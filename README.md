# Swift-Data-Demo

Code With Chris tutorial to introduce myself to SwiftData. Most of this is familiar to me through CSE 3200 - App Development at UConn, but it is very interesting to see the different between Swift and Kotlin.

Key Takeaways:

1. Understanding SwiftUI
	•	Declarative UI Design: I gained a deeper understanding of SwiftUI’s declarative syntax, enabling me to design clean, responsive user interfaces.
	•	Dynamic Components: I learned how to use @State, @Environment, and @Binding to create dynamic, state-driven UIs.
	•	List Management: Building the app taught me how to create and manage dynamic lists, making it easier to display data in real time.

2. Learning SwiftData
	•	Model Creation: I explored the @Model annotation to define lightweight, efficient data models that integrate seamlessly into SwiftUI.
	•	Data Persistence Concepts: While this project doesn’t yet include persistent storage, I now understand how to manage data in-memory using SwiftData.
	•	Data Querying: Using the @Query property wrapper, I learned how to fetch and display data dynamically in the UI.

3. Integration of UI and Logic
	•	Button Actions: I implemented a simple action using the Button component, which allowed me to dynamically add items to the list.
	•	Functionality First: This project taught me how to prioritize functionality and then enhance the UI incrementally.

4. Project Structuring and Best Practices
	•	Separation of Concerns: I structured the app into clear components: a ContentView for the UI and a DataItem model for the logic.
	•	Using Environment and Contexts: I learned to work with the @Environment property to access and modify shared data contexts.
